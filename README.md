We provide a stand-alone function to compute Shapley value for a cooperative game in characteristic function form.  Our function relies
on the R function intToBits which converts an integer vector into a matrix of binary representations, but for our purpose it provides
an efficient means to compute across game coalitions.  We provide five examples which are hopefully both illustrative and interesting.
